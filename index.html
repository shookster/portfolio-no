          Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start
          dating his sister. That might've been one of the shortest assignments
          in the history of Starfleet. You did exactly what you had to do. You
          considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you
          made the hard choice. Talk about going nowhere fast. Earl Grey tea,
          watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for
          promotion? What? We're not at all alike! They were just sucked into
          space. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. We have a
          saboteur aboard. This is not about revenge. This is about justice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Well, that's certainly good to know. Your head is not an artifact!
          Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders
          around here. Damage report! Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy.
          You enjoyed that. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your
          only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank
          of prisoner to that of lieutenant? About four years. I got tired of
          hearing how young I looked. I'll be sure to note that in my log.
          Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Mr. Worf, you do
          remember how to fire phasers? Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches...
          and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? But the probability of
          making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. When has
          justice ever been as simple as a rule book? The unexpected is our
          normal routine. Not if I weaken first.
        </p>
